                        J.Miller Custom Cues is a culmination of my love for pool and billiards, for fine woodworking, and for the
                        exploration of the metaphysical / spiritual world. It is the result of years of research, trial and error, and
                        expanding my comfort zones to try new things. This journey has been my dream since my early 20’s
                        when I first started playing serious pool in college. Since then, I’ve worked different jobs in countless
                        industries, built an amazing and supportive family, and finally bought a house and built a workshop from
                        the ground up. Now, 30 years (along with many scars and wrinkles) later, the pieces are finally coming
                        together.

                        I offer one-of-a-kind, customized cues that are a reflection of the player holding it. I want to get to know
                        the player on a deeper level. What are your hopes and dreams? What speaks to your soul? And how can
                        we channel that into intentions at the pool table?

                        Whether it’s something loud and proud showing the world who you are and what you’re about; or
                        something small and seemingly insignificant to others that connects you to your loved ones, your
                        beliefs, your passions; or perhaps, something so personal that it guides you across town to go hit a little
                        white ball around a table at 2am, I want to take that journey with you and create something that will
                        connect your heart and soul to the table beneath you.
